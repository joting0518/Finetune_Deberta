# AES: Automatic Essay Scoring using DeBERTa

This project focuses on **Automatic Essay Scoring (AES)**, particularly tailored for **IELTS writing tasks**. We fine-tune a DeBERTa model to assess writing quality either as a **classification** or **regression** task.

## ðŸ§  Core Idea

Using pretrained language models like `microsoft/deberta-v3-base`, we fine-tune on IELTS writing data to predict human-like writing scores.

## ðŸ“Š Experiment: Regression vs Classification in AES

During the fine-tuning of the DeBERTa language model for AES (Automatic Essay Scoring), we experimented with two different objective functions: **regression** and **classification**.

### ðŸ“‰ Regression Training Results

As shown in the figure below, when training the model with a **regression objective**, the loss failed to converge properly and continued to fluctuate over time.

Further evaluation showed that the model's predicted average score was 6.0. Upon analysis, we found this was due to **imbalanced data distribution**, which made it difficult for the model to learn meaningful score representations through regression. The essay score distribution is shown below:

### âœ… Classification Training Results

To address the convergence issue, we re-formulated the problem as a **classification task**. Scores were mapped into 19 discrete classes, and the model was trained using **Cross-Entropy loss**.

This approach allowed the model to learn more robustly from the data and converge successfully, as illustrated in the following loss curves:

Final evaluation results show that the model's predicted scores closely match human-labeled scores, with a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.7064**, which is approximately within Â±0.5 band of the true IELTS scoring range.

**Conclusion:**  
Formulating AES as a **classification** task provides significantly better training stability and scoring accuracy compared to regression, especially when working with imbalanced writing score distributions.
